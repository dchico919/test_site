#### Description: In this project I certantly added the required html, sql, and flask coding. I coded my project in Python. One day, I was asked to complete a task that included creating an excel spreadsheet that would calculate the mathatimatics for their income and spending and the like. Creating this code was both exilerating and exhausting. Just as told in the classes I did aquire my own duckies to talk to. Since I didn't have much people to talk to about my fustrations with the code. It was literally like me talking to wall, so the duckies are amazing. I got two and named them Rick and Morty. Anyway, I digress. So, I decided to make a website that could work around the type of buisness they were decideding to move forward with. In this website the user would be allowed to recieve a code whether they were a guest or registered user. If you were only a guest user then you uwould be permitted 1(one) quote for every email used. The input of the guest user is saved in a database labeled database1.db. When they enter the email it would be stored in the appropriate folder and then used in the next page. The way the code is now is only uploaded as completing the assignment and i do hope to continue to add more to it in order for it to be used on a live server.
